"""One real HPC submission, against whatever endpoint the environment names.

This is the tier that answers backlog A1: *no HPC endpoint has ever executed a
task for this agent*. `test_orbit_local.py` proves the client against a localhost
broker we start ourselves; this proves the path against an endpoint we do not
own — a scheduler, a queue, an allocation.

Deliberately trivial jobs. The question is whether submit → poll → logs → cancel
work across a real broker, not whether ProteinMPNN is installed at the far end.

Run it:

    DESIGNAGENT_ORBIT_ENABLED=true \\
    RADICAL_ORBIT_BROKER_URL=https://broker.site:8443 \\
    RADICAL_ORBIT_BROKER_CERT=/path/broker_cert.pem \\
    RADICAL_ORBIT_BROKER_TOKEN=... \\
    DESIGNAGENT_ORBIT_PSIJ_EXECUTOR=slurm \\
    DESIGNAGENT_ORBIT_ACCOUNT=... DESIGNAGENT_ORBIT_QUEUE=... \\
    .venv/bin/python -m pytest -m remote -q

Nothing is hardcoded to localhost, so `DESIGNAGENT_ORBIT_LOCAL=true` runs the
same assertions against the development stack first. Check the credentials with
`python -m designagent --check-config --probe` before spending a queue slot.
