"""The remote-workflow interface.

Shared shape for Orbit and Globus Compute. Both give us "submit now, finish
later", but they differ in ways the agent must not have to care about:

  - Orbit pushes status events over a websocket; Globus only resolves a future.
  - Orbit's PSI/J plugin tails logs by byte offset; Globus has no log stream.
  - Orbit can cancel a running task; Globus can only cancel before it starts.

Hence `Capabilities`, and a `logs()` that returns an empty chunk rather than
raising where tailing is unsupported.
