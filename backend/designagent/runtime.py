"""Application runtime: builds the whole stack and tears it down cleanly.

Startup order matters:
  1. rhapsody ConcurrentExecutionBackend over a ProcessPoolExecutor
  2. flowgentic LangraphIntegration, which creates the asyncflow WorkflowEngine
  3. task interfaces (local tasks routed through flowgentic to the pool)
  4. optional Orbit interface for remote HPC workflows
  5. the checkpointer, then the compiled graph

Everything is optional downwards: if flowgentic or rhapsody cannot start, the
agent still runs with plain asyncio task execution, because a broken deployment
substrate should not make the chatbot unusable.

Settings can change while the process runs (`PUT /api/settings`). Which parts
have to restart depends on who reads the value: anything a *task body* reads is
baked into the pool workers at fork, so it needs a new pool, and a new pool means
a new flowgentic integration, task wrapper and compiled graph. Orbit credentials
are read only in this process, so they need nothing but a reconnect. See
`needs_rebuild` and `Runtime.reconfigure`.
