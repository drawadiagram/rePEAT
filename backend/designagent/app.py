"""The web API.

Chat is a POST that returns an SSE stream, carrying four kinds of frame:

  token    - assistant text as it is generated
  status   - a progress line from a node ("Folding 6 candidates…")
  task     - a task's lifecycle (submitted / log / finished / canceled)
  state    - the state keys the UI renders (artifacts, ensemble, lead, viz)
  done     - end of turn

POST rather than GET-with-EventSource because the prompt belongs in a body; the
frontend reads the stream with fetch + ReadableStream.
