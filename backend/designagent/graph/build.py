"""Graph assembly.

Nodes run as plain LangGraph nodes by default, and *tasks* are what get routed
through flowgentic to the rhapsody process pool (see runtime.py).

Why not wrap nodes as flowgentic EXECUTION_BLOCKs: that runs the node body on
asyncflow's own event loop, outside LangGraph's runnable context, so
`get_stream_writer()` raises "Called get_config outside of a runnable context"
and every status update and token is silently dropped. Streaming progress to the
chat matters more than having asyncflow schedule the nodes, and the wrapping
otherwise buys nothing here: its retry/timeout has to be disabled for nodes that
legitimately wait on an HPC job.

`wrap_nodes=True` restores the block wrapping for anyone who wants asyncflow to
own node execution and can live without custom-event streaming.
