"""LLM access with a deterministic fallback.

Every node must work with no API key, so callers use `complete()` / `classify()`
and handle `None` by falling back to rules. Clients are built per call rather
than cached on a module global, because task bodies may run in a pool worker.

`None` alone cannot say *why* the rules were used, and "no key" and "the key you
just typed in was rejected" need different answers from the UI. Pass
`on_fallback=` to receive a short reason; nodes hand it a collector that appends
to the `warnings` state channel, which the interpreter already renders under
"Caveats from this run".
